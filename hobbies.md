<br>There must be **something truly magical** about persistence, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. I really enjoy the process,which clam me down. Through this,i make many friends and learn to insist on one thing.



## Swimming 

<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.
